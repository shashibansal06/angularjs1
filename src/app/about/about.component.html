        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Lychees is founded on the belief that an active relationship between consumers and service providers through feedback can produce better products and results for a business.</p>
        <p>Our mission is to change the way the general population interacts with online and offline products. Dissatisfaction with product features is currently a dead end for consumers with very little recourse past moving onto an alternative product. Providing feedback usually requires and investment of time and effort that gives zero return for the consumer. Our aim is the change the sentiment of dissatisfaction into a positive experience and opportunity.</p>
        <p>By rewarding feedback with a fair system we can change attitudes and create a loop between the consumer and product development team to allow for improvements against consumer needs.</p>
